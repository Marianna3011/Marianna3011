## 👩‍💻 About Me

I'm currently pursuing a **Bachelor's in Artificial Intelligence** at **Poznan University of Technology**.  
I enjoy solving real-world problems with data-driven and AI-powered solutions—from classical machine learning to modern neural networks.  
I’m especially excited about automating workflows and building tools that make systems more efficient.

## 🚀 Projects

- **🎶 Emotion Classification from Song Lyrics**  
  Built a multi-class emotion detection system using both classical NLP (TF-IDF + Logistic Regression) and embedding-based models (GloVe + SVM) on the MERGE dataset.  
  Achieved strong performance with low computational complexity, evaluated via macro-averaged F1 scores.

- **🩺 Endometriosis Risk Prediction**  
  In collaboration with a medical university, built a data pipeline and Random Forest model to predict endometriosis risk from survey data.  
  Included data cleaning, preprocessing, feature engineering, and model development. Culminated in a scientific manuscript.

- **🎲 Board Game State Detection (Splendor)**  
  Created an OpenCV-based system to annotate board game videos by detecting cards, tokens, and plates across different angles using perspective transformation.  
  Tested on the game *Splendor*, ensuring accurate, multi-angle game state detection.

- **📄 Document Upload Automation Bot**  
  Developed a Python + Selenium tool with a GUI that automates document uploads from Excel-based metadata.  
  Used by a nationwide furniture company to streamline digital records processing.
