## 👩‍💻 About Me

I'm currently pursuing a **Bachelor’s in Artificial Intelligence** at **Poznan University of Technology**.  
Since high school, I’ve been deeply interested in **data analysis**—curious about how raw information becomes actionable insight.  
Over time, this interest evolved into a strong passion for **machine learning, automation, and AI**, with a focus on using data to drive real-world decisions and improvements.

I enjoy building tools that combine analytics with intelligent automation, and I’m particularly excited by projects that reduce manual effort or increase clarity through visualization and intelligent systems.

## 🚀 Projects

- **🎶 Emotion Classification from Song Lyrics**  
  Built a multi-class emotion detection system using both classical NLP (TF-IDF + Logistic Regression) and embedding-based models (GloVe + SVM) on the MERGE dataset.  
  Achieved strong performance with low computational complexity, evaluated via macro-averaged F1 scores.

- **🩺 Endometriosis Risk Prediction**  
  In collaboration with a medical university, built a data pipeline and Random Forest model to predict endometriosis risk from survey data.  
  Included data cleaning, preprocessing, feature engineering, and model development. Culminated in a scientific manuscript.

- **🎲 Board Game State Detection (Splendor)**  
  Created an OpenCV-based system to annotate board game videos by detecting cards, tokens, and plates across different angles using perspective transformation.  
  Tested on the game *Splendor*, ensuring accurate, multi-angle game state detection.

- **📄 Document Upload Automation Bot**  
  Developed a Python + Selenium tool with a GUI that automates document uploads from Excel-based metadata.  
  Used by a nationwide furniture company to streamline digital records processing.
  
- **📊 Supermarket Sales Dashboard (Power BI)**  
  Created an interactive dashboard in Power BI using a Kaggle dataset to analyze supermarket sales performance.  
  Integrated dynamic slicers and visuals for filtering by product type, location, and time.

- **📚 Distributed Study Room Reservation System**  
  Designed and built a distributed system for managing university study room reservations using **Cassandra**, **Docker**, and a **Tkinter GUI**.  
  Focused on scalability, fault tolerance, and an intuitive user interface with microservice architecture.

- **🎵 In Progress: Music Emotion Recognition**  
  Currently working on a system to classify emotional content in music using the **MERGE dataset**.  
  Exploring deep learning models and audio feature extraction for multilabel classification.
